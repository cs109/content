Also put the data folder in this folder. **Make sure everything still works!** Select Kernel->Restart Kernel to restart Python, Cell->Run All to run all cells. You shouldn't hit any errors. Compress the folder (please use .zip compression) and submit to the CS109 dropbox in the appropriate folder. If we cannot access your work because these directions are not followed correctly, we will not grade your work."
